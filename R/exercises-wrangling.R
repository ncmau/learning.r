# exercise 2 --------------------------------------------------------------
# Create a new variable called “UrineVolAverage” by calculating the average urine volumne (from “UrineVol1” and “UrineVol2”).
# Modify/replace the “Pulse” variable to beats per second (currently is beats per minute).
# Create a new variable called “YoungChild” when age is less than 6 years.


# Check the names of the variables

# Pipe the data into mutate function and:
NHANES_modified <- NHANES %>% # dataset

    # 1. Calculate average urine volume
    UrineVolAv = (UrineVol1 + UrineVol2)/2,
    # 2. Modify Pulse variable
    Pulse_per_second = Pulse/60,

# exercise 2 --------------------------------------------------------------
# Filter so only those with BMI more than 20 and less than 40 and keep only those with diabetes.
# Filter to keep those who are working (“Work”) or those who are renting (“HomeOwn”) and those who do not have diabetes. Select the variables age, gender, work status, home ownership, and diabetes status.
# Using sorting and selecting, find out who has had the most number of babies and how old they are.
